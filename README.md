### Pixel Map Icons
---

A collection of hand-drawn pixel art icons by me to use as map pins in Valheim!

*These icons were designed to work in conjunction with [KGvalheim's MoreMapPins](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/KGvalheim/MoreMapPins/) but by renaming them you can make them fit in almost any mod that adds map pins.*

I'll try to update this mod everytime I'm done with a biome.

Feel free to request ([Github Issue](https://github.com/TheOllix/PixelMapIcons/issues)) a specific icon that you think fits the theme.

If you are not sure what each icon means, [here is a list of the original file names for each icon.](https://github.com/TheOllix/PixelMapIcons/blob/main/IconNames.md)

***Warning: This icon pack will override the icons you already have at MoreMapPins' config folder.***
