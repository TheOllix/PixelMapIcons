# ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOllix/icons24px/refs/heads/main/24_map.png) Pixel Map Icons 

A collection of hand-drawn Valheim themed pixel art icons to use as map pins!

*These icons were designed to work in conjunction with [KGvalheim's MoreMapPins](https://thunderstore.io/c/valheim/p/KGvalheim/MoreMapPins/) but by renaming them you can make them fit in almost any mod that adds map pins.*

I'll try to update this mod everytime I'm done with a biome's icon set.

Feel free to use the ([Github Issue Page](https://github.com/TheOllix/PixelMapIcons/issues)) to request icons or suggest changes to existing ones.

If you are not sure what each icon is supposed to be, [here is a list of the original file names for each icon.](https://github.com/TheOllix/PixelMapIcons/blob/main/IconNames.md)

***Warning: This icon pack will override the icons you already have at MoreMapPins' config folder.***
